Onshape Example Client using PHP

This example shows how to create an Onshape client with a PHP backend (basically no server) and OAuth authentication.  All of the backend support is handled by simple PHP LAMHDAs.  To use this you need to

1. Clone/fork the repository to your own machine to edit
1. Identify a server where the minimal backend components will be hosted.  For purposes of this example, we shall assume that they are at https://ftconshape.com/oauthexample/
1. Create an Onshape OAuth application at https://dev-portal.onshape.com/oauthApps.  When you create the App, remember the Secret (which you can only see once) and the client id.
1. In the settings, set the redirect URL to be the URL from step 2.  Also, make sure you select an Admin team who has access to the applicaiton.
1. Copy example_config.php as config.php and update the client id and client secret.
1. For the settings in the Redirect URLs, point it to the location of the backend components (in this case `https://ftconshape.com/oauthexample/`)
1. Create an extension entry (we are using an Element Right Panel here) and for the action URL, enter the following.  Note that you need to replace `<clientid>` with the client id you got in step 3 and the `<backenduri>` from step 2 but with the URL encoded (you can use https://www.urlencoder.org/ to encode the URL).  While you are there, don't forget to update the icon with a `.svg` file.

     `https://oauth.onshape.com/oauth/confirm_access?response_type=code&client_id=<clientid>%3D&redirect_uri=<backenduri>%3FdocumentId%3D{$documentId}%26workspaceId%3D{$workspaceOrVersionId}%26elementId%3D{$elementId}`

1. Change the line in app/app.ts for myserver to be the server from step 1 (but leave off the trailing /)
   ```
    public myserver = 'https://ftconshape.com/oauthexample';
    ```     
1. Do a `npm run build` 
1. Copy the files from the `dist` directory (don't forget the `.htaccess` files) to your server.

If you have done everything right, when you add the application to your account, you should see an icon appear on the right hand edge of the screen (along with the configuration and appearance icons).  When you click on it, it may promopt you for permissions and then once it has been granted will show a dump of all the files you have shared with you.

To make change so the application, edit the `app/app.ts` file.  It is built on top of the `app/baseapp.ts` file which has all the common routines.
